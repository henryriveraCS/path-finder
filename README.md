<b>Pathfinding algorithms written in python3.</b>

<b> HOW TO RUN: </b>
  1. git clone this repo to any local folder
  2. point the terminal into location where <code>requirements.txt</code> is
  3. run <code> pip install -r requirements.txt </code>
  4. Once libraries are installed just use <code>python3 algos/astar.py</code> (or any other .py file inside algos)

Will add more algos + a visualization of the paths later
