<b>Pathfinding algorithms written in natively in python3.</b>

<b> HOW TO RUN: </b>
  1. git clone this repo to any local folder
  2. point the terminal into location where the files are
  4. use <code>python3 algos/astar.py</code> (or any other .py file inside algos)

Will add more algos + a visualization of the paths later
